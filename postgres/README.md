# hass-postgres

A postgres database addon for home assistant

It is configured to have a single database and user with no UI. It is also not the latest version of postgres... it is the latest that taiga is compatible with.

If you would like an up-to-date postgres addon, consider [this timescaledb addon](https://github.com/Expaso/hassos-addons/tree/master/timescaledb) which includes postgres and a UI for managing it.

## TODO:

- Make the password configurable
